# Find whether a subarray is in form of a mountain or not

We are given an array of integers and a range, we need to find whether the subarray which falls in this range has values in the form of a mountain or not. All values of the subarray are said to be in the form of a mountain if:

- either all values are increasing or decreasing
- values are first increasing and then decreasing. 

More formally a subarray `[a1, a2, a3 … aN]` is said to be in form of a mountain if there exist an integer `K`, `1 <= K <= N` such that, `a1 <= a2 <= a3 .. <= aK >= a(K+1) >= a(K+2) …. >= aN`.

## Examples

````sh
Input : Arr[]  = [2 3 2 4 4 6 3 2], Range = [0, 2]
Output :  Yes
````

Explanation: The output is yes , subarray is [2 3 2], so subarray first increases and then decreases

````sh
Input:  Arr[] = [2 3 2 4 4 6 3 2], Range = [2, 7]
Output: Yes
````

Explanation: The output is yes , subarray is [2 4 4 6 3 2], so subarray first increases and then decreases

````sh
Input: Arr[]= [2 3 2 4 4 6 3 2], Range = [1, 3]
Output: no
````

Explanation: The output is no, subarray is [3 2 4], so subarray is not in the form above stated

## C++ Solution

### Pseudocode

The problem has multiple queries so for each query the solution should be calculated with least possible time complexity. So create two extra spaces of the length of the original array. For every element find the last index on the left side which is increasing i.e. greater than its previous element and find the element on the right side will store the first index on the right side which is decreasing i.e. greater than its next element. If these value can be calculated for every index in constant time then for every given range the answer can be given in constant time.

- Create two extra spaces of length `n`, `left` and `right` and a extra variable `lastptr`
- Initilize `left[0] = 0` and `lastptr = 0`
- Traverse the original array from second index to the end
- For every index check if it is greater than the pervious element, if yes then update the `lastptr` with the current index.
- For every index store the `lastptr` in `left[i]`
- initilize `right[N-1] = N-1` and `lastptr = N-1`
- Traverse the original array from second last index to the start
- For every index check if it is greater than the next element, if yes then update the `lastptr` with the current index.
- For every index store the `lastptr` in `right[i]`
- Now process the queries
- for every query `l`, `r`, if `right[l] >= left[r]` then print `yes` else `no`

## Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexiity : O(n).

Only two traversals are needed so the time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity : O(n).

Two extra space of length n is required so the space complexity is O(n).
