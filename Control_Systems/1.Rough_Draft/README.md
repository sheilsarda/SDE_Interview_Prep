# Prompt

Assume that you are a member of a team designing an electromagnetic system to remotely control a microbot moving in  a live animal's body.  Assume the microbot is on the scale of ~500 micron, and is made of a rigid inorganic material. The microbot is supposed to move through liquid inside a live animal in a precise, safe manner.  Assume that your job as is to develop the motion control algorithm of the microbot. The consists of an external device generating electromagnetic fields that drive the microbot remotely in the animal’s body. Your software's input includes an imaging data stream captured by Xray, observing the animal’s body. Your software's output is a control command data stream to your external electromagnetic device, which controls the microbot motion remotely. You need to be sure that you don't lose track of the microbot, track it in real time and control its motion in a precise, safe manner, while at the same time generating sufficient forces and torques with a high degree of precision to allow for efficient motion in the animal body. Please prepare a PPT presentation describing your design of control algorithm. Please describe the most important design criteria you have considered, the pros/cons of various approaches considered, the key sources of risk and how you are addressing them. Please do your best to present a complete picture rather than focusing on a single aspect of the problem.

## Requirements

1. ~500 micron scale made of rigid inorganic material
1. Can move through liquid inside a live animal
1. Control system outputs are electromagnetic fields generated by external devices
1. Simultaneously track and have real-time control over the microbot
1. Generate sufficient forces and torques with a high degree of precision to allow for efficient motion in the animal body

## Output

Prepare a PPT presentation describing your design of control algorithm, presenting a complete picture rather than focusing on a single aspect of the problem:
- Describe the most important design criteria you have considered
- Pros/cons of various approaches considered
- Key sources of risk and how you are addressing them
