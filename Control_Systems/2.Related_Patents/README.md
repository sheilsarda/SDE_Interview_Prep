Smaller magnetic fins attached to the main body symmetrically all around its axis ( cylindrical symmetry ) ; where each fin has a fixed polarity, aligned with the polarity of the main - body of the particle , based on an embedded magnetic component in the fin with a sufficiently strong magnetic moment. Such fins can be produced, for example, from the elastomer films that are described in Mishra et al. , or alternatively by other suitable techniques known in the art . Such films comprise for example Fe304 magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs ) and thermoplastic polyurethane ( TPU ) . The films are nanocomposites comprising the polymer and the magnetic nanoparticles . Assembly of the MNPs into chains causes a directional dependence in the magnetostatic energy , allowing for anisotropic actuation of the composite in 3D . The fins are attached to the main body with a flexible attachment point and / or are made of flexible material , so they can tilt or " flap ” when placed in an external magnetic field ( since they are magnetic , they can tilt to align with the external mag netic field ) ; in this case the main - body of the particle is also subject to a rotating torque aligning it with the external magnetic field ; since the body is larger than the fins it can tilt more slowly , subject to drag in viscoelastic media , allowing the fins to “ flap ” relative to the body

The solid particle body can range in size from a few nanometers to a few micrometers and exhibit specific and tunable magnetic properties . The adjustable magnetic features are diamagnetic , paramagnetic , superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic , depending on chemical composition , crystalline structure and size of the particles used . 

More specifically , representative examples of particle candidates include neodymium ( ex . , Nd2Fe14B ( “ A magnetic membrane actuator in composite technology utilizing diamagnetic levitation , ” IEEE Sens . J. 13 ( 2013 ) , pages 27862797 ) , carbon - coated Fe ( “ Microfabrication of magnetically actuated PDMS- Iron composite membranes , ” Microelectr .Engineer . 98 ( 2012 ) , pages 607-609 ) , iron ( II / III ) oxides( “ Magnetically - actuated artificial cilia for microfluidics propulsion , ” Lab Chip . 11 ( 2011 ) , pages 2002-2010 ) , cobalt alloy ( s ) ( “ A facile template - free approach to magnetodriven multifunctional artificial cilia , ” Appl .

- Miniature device may be configured such that the magnetic arrangement, within a rotating magnetic field, effects the propulsion of the miniature device within the patient, and, within a magnetic field gradient, effects the performance of the function
- Drive thread formed on an exterior surface thereof helically about the drive axis, the magnetic arrangement comprising a propulsion magnet rigidly connected to an interior surface thereof and disposed such that the vector of its magnetic moment, i.e., the orientation of its north and south poles, is disposed transverse to the drive axis
- Rack and pinion actuator movement: rotation of the pinion gear about its rotation axis causes linear motion between it and the linear gear
-  The interaction of the drive thread 110 with its external surroundings in the patient causes the miniature device to be propelled therein

**System and method for remotely maneuvering a magnetic miniature device**

- The system 100 may be further capable of determining how to operate its components (e.g., what angles to pivot each of the coils 102 along its respective pivot and/or gimbal axes 108, 112, what strengths the magnetic fields induced by the coils should be, how the platform 114 should be moved, etc.) in order to maneuver the miniature device along the path and/or along a path which acceptably conforms (i.¢e., within o) to the route. This determination may made based on any suitable method. 
- According to some examples, the system 100 is configured to determine how to operate its components in order to generate the necessary magnetic fields by calculating the spatial magnetic field distribution around the coils 102 in different orientations thereof, and in different positions of the miniature device relative thereto, in order to facilitate arriving at this determination.
- Biot-Savart law and/or Lorentz equations may be applied with any suitably reasonable approximations and/or analytical forms of the spatial magnetic field distribution
- System 100 may be configured to monitor the reaction of the miniature device when applying a magnetic field thereto. The monitoring may be visual, for example using image-recognition software on x-ray images, and/or the monitoring may comprise obtaining feedback from the miniature device by inducing a magnetic pulse. Such an approach may be used in real time, i.e., modifying operational parameters of the system 100 based on how closely the miniature device confirmed to the route and/or path, and/or the reactions of the miniature device to a set of operational parameters may be used to train an artificial intelligence (i.e., machine learning) model to train the system 100 to utilize its components to predictably control the miniature device by varying the operational parameters of its components. Any suitable machine learning algorithm may be used, for example using an artificial neural network applying a Deep Q-learning algorithm. Such machine learning approaches may be performed in-vitro, i.e., in a simulated environment not using a live patient, for example in a human or non-human cadaver, in a model of a patient, etc., and/or in-vivo. A trial-and-error approach may include inducing a magnetic field, and varying it when the miniature device deviates from the path by more than o in any direction. It may further include selectively reversing the magnetic in order to maneuver the miniature robot along a path in a reverse direction to that immediately preceding it.

- One mode of propulsion involves applying an external uniform rotating magnetic field on internal device located inside the body. According to this mode , the internal device has a helical or a related shape ( screw -like) exhibit ing asymmetry and it comprises an embedded magnet with diametric magnetization. Rotating the external field exerts congruent rotational torque on the device , propelling it forward (like a screw ) . It is expected that reversing the external rotational field direction will yield a respective reverse particle dynamics . This propulsion method is denoted as “ rotation ."
- Another propulsion mode involves applying an external non - uniform magnetic field ( a “ magnetic gradient ” ) performing increasing strength along a controllable line ( a " gradient line” ) to an internal device located inside the body. The device includes an embedded magnet or a metallic component. In response to the external field gradient, the device moves along the gradient lines generated by the external magnet. This propulsion method is denoted as " gradient-based motion . [ 0006 ] A combination of the two above propulsion tech niques are required to properly propel the bot through the tissue as each propulsion mode impacts the bot differently. [ 0007] It is worth noting that the same magnetic system can be used to control other types of functionality of the bot remotely using a combination of magnetic field rotation and / or magnetic gradient, applied at a predefined time at a particular configuration, in parallel or separately from the propulsion of the bot . For example , in one embodiment the bot may contain an internal magneto -mechanic mechanism which extrudes a particular payload to the surrounding
