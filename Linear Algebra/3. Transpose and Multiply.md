# Transpose and Multiply Matrices

You’ve been tasked with writing a high-performance, portable linear algebra library for a client who has an awful case of not-invented-here syndrome. This means: 

- Only use standard libraries (and miss out on the decades of optimizations in various BLAS implementations)
- The client has asked for just transpose and multiplication of `MxN` matrices
- Demonstrate the correctness of your solution
- Solution should be well-documented so that it can be used and maintained by the client’s engineering staff
- Free to choose the underlying matrix representation and interface

## C++ Solution

**Note:** Your solution should be implemented in standard C++11 (g++ or clang++ on Linux). To keep things simple, the library may be header-only. You may include a `Makefile/CMakeLists.txt`, or you may specify the compiler command used to compile your source file: `g++ main.cpp -std=c++11 -lthread`
