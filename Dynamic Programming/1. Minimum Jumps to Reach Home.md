# Minimum Jumps to Reach Home

A certain bug's home is on the x-axis at position `x`. Help them get there from position 0.

The bug jumps according to the following rules:

- It can jump exactly a positions forward (to the right).
- It can jump exactly b positions backward (to the left).
- It cannot jump backward twice in a row.
- It cannot jump to any forbidden positions.
- The bug may jump forward beyond its home, but it cannot jump to positions numbered with negative integers.

Given an array of integers `forbidden`, where `forbidden[i]` means that the bug cannot jump to the position `forbidden[i]`, and integers `a`, `b`, and `x`, return the minimum number of jumps needed for the bug to reach its home. 

If there is no possible sequence of jumps that lands the bug on position `x`, return -1.
